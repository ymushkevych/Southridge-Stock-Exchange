# AI Use Transparency
1. Part of the code for the SSE was written by ChatGPT model 4.
2. The functions for the Lagrange Polynomial and Least Squares Regression Line (LSRL) were also provided by ChatGPT model 4.
3. All work done by AI was double-checked and verified to be correct by a human.
4. Use of AI was minimized as much as possible throughout this project and was used primarily as a teaching aid for coding sections I didn't understand, rather than a primary contributor to the project.
